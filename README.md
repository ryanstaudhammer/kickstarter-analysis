Lucky for her she has access to a large amount of information based on other productions that have been successful, failed, were canceled or are still live. She also has information regarding the format types of productions as parent categories like film and video, music, and theater to name a few as well as subcategories like audio, fiction, plays, and television. She has access to a total of 4115 productions' data in an excel spreadsheet.
