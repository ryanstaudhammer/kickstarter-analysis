# An analysis of Kickstarter campaigns
## This project is intended to provide useful information regarding accessing funding for a production based on previous productions' funding goals and launch dates. 
## Accessing the information
Louise wants to produce an upcoming play. Naturally, she wants her play to be successful. Lucky for her she has access to a large amount of information based on other productions that have been successful, failed, were canceled or are still live. She also has information regarding the format types of productions as parent categories like film and video, music, and theater to name a few as well as subcategories like audio, fiction, plays, and television. She has access to a total of 4115 productions' data in an excel spreadsheet. In order to help her fund her play we have narrowed some of the information she has access to in order to find the most relevant information. 

## Based on the Analysis
We have provided Louise with an anaylysis of other plays within the theater Category for her to make decisions.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- We can draw two conclusions about the Outcomes based on Launch Date. First the data appears to support that outcomes had a higher success rate when the productions were initiated in early summer, or more specifically in May. Though we can also see that a failure rate is higher in May as well which is likely a result simply of more productions being launched in May. Second, we can see that the highest failure rate is in October, so that may be a time to avoid launching a new production. 
- We can conclude the Outcomes based on Goals

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
